<p>When you choose a ticket, it's a good idea to consider its cost. Let's implement the ability to check the ticket price!</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Show a ticket price on the <code class="java">Toast</code> when you click on a seat;</li>
<li>The price is the base price weighted by its row position. Seats closer to the screen have a fixed maximum weight of <code class="java">1.5</code>. The minimum weight is the target weight of <code class="java">0.5</code>. To calculate the middle seat weights, find the weight step â€” the difference between the max and min weights divided by the number of rows. The weight of each particular row decreases evenly starting from the max weight to the min weight;</li>
<li>The seat ticket price is calculated by multiplying the base ticket cost by row weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if we have <code class="java">10</code> rows with a base ticket cost of <code class="java">10</code>. The difference between the max and the min weight is <code class="java">1.0</code>. The weight step is <code class="java">0.1</code>. Seat prices are as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex">\[[(10 \times 1.5), (10 \times 1.4), (10 \times 1.3), (10 \times 1.2), (10 \times 1.1), (10 \times 1.0), (10 \times 0.9), (10 \times 0.8), (10 \times 0.7), (10 \times 0.6)]\]</span></p>
<p>Mind that the farthest row's actual weight can be higher than the target minimum weight, but the closest row's actual weight is always equal to the maximum weight.</p>
